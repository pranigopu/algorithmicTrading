Algorithmic trading introduction
---*---*---
Algorithmic trading is the use of algorithms utilised by computers to make investment decisions. The main difference in different trading algorithms is speed of execution.
___
Programming languages used
--x--
Due to the simplicity, compactness of its codes and availability of a vast range of libraries, Python is the most popular language in the development and implementation of trading algorithms.

However, due to the slower speed of Python code, we often use Python codes as triggers for codes written in other faster languages. This is seen in the use of Numpy, which is a Python library but is implemented using C (a much faster language than Python).
___
General steps in algorithmic trading
--x--
1. Collect data
2. Develop a hypothesis (on which the investment strategy will be based)
3. Test the strategy on past data that ranges across time periods and locations
   (backtesting)
4. Implement the strategy for real
--x--
For example, imagine the following. You collected data on a large number of firms, with records containing various business measures for each firm.

After performing statistical tests to determine the significant factors for one or business measures that you care about, you hypothesise that the liquidity of a company (measured by the working capital ratio i.e. ratio between current assets and current liabilities) is a major factor in determining the value of a company, and predicts future increases in share values.

You then develop a strategy based on this hypothesis (which could be as simple as looking for the company with the highest liquidity, or more complex, such as an algorithm that may also consider other factors), and test it on historical data, preferably across multiple regions in the world.

If the strategy sufficiently accurate in determining high value companies, you implement this strategy in an algorithm and eventually a code.

Value investment definition
___
Value investment means investing in stocks (i.e. company shares) that are cheap relative to their value (which is evaluated using measures of business value such as earnings and assets).

Application programming interface
___
A programmable and configurable interface designed for enabling communication between applications (i.e. an interface for applications to directly communicate through with each other). In other terms, an API is a set of functions and procedures that allow one application to access the feature of other application

Securities of a company (in a financial market)
___
Securities are fungible (i.e. mutually interchangeable i.e. they may apply to any form of productive value in the company) and tradable financial instruments used to raise capital in public and private markets. There are primarily three types of securities:
1. Equity (provides ownership rights to holders)
2. Debt (essentially loans repaid with periodic payments)
3. Hybrids (combine aspects of debt and equity)
---*---*---
Stock market exchange
___
A location (physical or virtual) where shares of pubic listed companies are traded. A stock exchange enables stockbrokers to trade company stocks and other securities. A stock may be bought or sold only if it is listed on a stock exchange. Thus, it is the meeting place of the stock buyers and sellers.

Stock market index --featuring S&P 500--
___
Stock market indices are measures that give an insight into the trends of the capital markets and the attitude of investors towards a particular stock or set of stocks in an industry. Hence, a stock market index acts like a barometer which shows the overall conditions of the market.
___
In other terms, stock market index is a statistical measure (i.e. a value derived from the various measures of a company and other companies in the exchange, intended to convey information about the value of its stocks)
___
S&P 500
--x--
The Standard and Poor's 500, or simply the S&P 500, is a stock market index tracking the performance of 500 large companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.
